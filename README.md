# SV13: Extraction — CDN Service

This repo is a **static CDN** for the SV13: Extraction MMO.  
It serves:

- Unity **Addressables** bundles + catalogs
- UI images (Borén's Tablet, terminals, HoloLogs)
- Map images (e.g., Outpost 9 layout)
- Audio logs (e.g., Sigma Audio Logs)
- Any other static assets the game client or API needs via URL

This repo is **only for the MMO**, not the TCG/CCG projects.
